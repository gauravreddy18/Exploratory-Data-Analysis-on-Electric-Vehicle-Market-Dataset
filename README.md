# Exploratory Data Analysis on Electric Vehicle Market Dataset

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python libraries â€” Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.  
The analysis explores the structure and patterns in an **Electric Vehicle (EV) Market dataset**, visualizing both numerical and categorical variables to uncover insights, correlations, and anomalies.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Key Objectives
- Understand data distribution using **histograms**  
- Identify outliers using **boxplots**  
- Explore categorical variable frequency using **count plots**  
- Analyze relationships between variables using a **correlation heatmap**

---

### ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization  

---

### ðŸ“Š Visualizations
1. **Histograms** â€” Distribution of numerical variables  
2. **Count Plots** â€” Frequency of categorical variables  
3. **Boxplots** â€” Outlier detection  
4. **Heatmap** â€” Correlation between numerical features
